As a newcomer to London, they are hoping that they will be surrounded by residents aroudn their age, mid 20s. They are hoping also for good transportation links to their new job near London Bridge, as well as to central London.\n\nThis will be useful to compare different neighborhoods with one another to see which one best fits with the users' specfic interests. With additional analysis on local schools, it would also be beneficial for families looking for neighborhoods to settle into."

Further analysis can be done to determine popularity of venues during certain times, such as Thursday to Saturday evenings which are known to return a high turnout of young people at particular venues such as bars and clubs.\n\nTransportation data can also be used to determine the number of major bus or tube routes that pass through the neighborhood to get to London Bridge and/or Central London, in order to determine how well connected the neighorhood is.\n"
